## <a name="access"> SoFy Access and Login Information </a>

### 1. How do I get access to the Solution Factory (SoFy)? 

* Existing HCL Customer—users with at least one active HCL FlexNet entitlement can request access by navigating to https://hclsofy.com and clicking the REQUEST ACCESS link in the upper right corner of the screen.   
* Customer Users Already Set Up in FlexNet (HCL Software‘s software distribution portal) — you will be granted access to SoFy almost immediately. If you are not yet set up, you need to be added to your organization’s account by your FlexNet administrator. 
* Prospects or organizations without active HCL entitlements—you can get access to SoFy as part of the regular HCL Software trial process; speak to our sales reps to place an order for a software trial for more information. 
* Urgent Access — when time is critical, prospective clients can be granted immediate access to [SoFy](https://hclsofy.com) for 7 calendar days. For support, please contact [Sales Operations team at Global Sales Operations](mailto:globalsaleops_sacoe@hcl.com).

## <a name="catalog"> The SoFy Catalog </a>

### 1. What is the SoFy Catalog?
* The Catalog is all of HCL's software offerings, in one place, that you can read about, explore, and add to your own unique product solutions to test out. Add items from The Catalog into your solutions and test them out in our SoFy Sandbox. 

### 2. In the SoFy Catalog, what is the difference between a Product, Module, and Demo Pack? 

* Our catalog offers three types of “Assets” - Products, Modules, and Demo Packs. Products are HCL's cloud native product offerings, Modules are product components or independent services which can be used as part of a larger solution, and Demo Packs combine data, configuration, and applications, to be installed with a product to provide a richer demo experience. 

### 3. Can I add any Product, Module, or Demo Pack together from The Catalog?  

* For the most part, yes! In the rare case of a software incompatibility, you will receive an error message and directions how to change your solution. 

### 4. How many Products or Modules can I add to my solution from The Catalog?  

* There is no limit to the number of modules you can add to your SoFy solution, however you may not be able to deploy a particularly large solution to the SoFy sandbox if it exceeds certain memory or CPU limits.

## <a name="solutions"> SoFy Solutions </a>

### 1. I finished creating my solution and just deployed into the Sandbox – why can’t I access it yet? 

* Your solution is in-progress! The Sandbox can take some time to deploy and start up – most solutions are available in just a few minutes, but more complicated applications may require up to an hour before they are ready to use. Check the progress icon in the Status section in the right-hand side of your Solution dashboard.

### 2. Once my solution has deployed and I’m in the Solution Console, are there any resources I can use to learn about the console and the SoFy Sandbox?

* Yes – there are Solution Console guides to aid your success in testing your solution in our Sandbox. On the teal left-hand side navigation bar, there is a section called ‘Guides’ that provides helpful documentation.


### 3. If I want to download my solution into the cloud of my choice, how long will it take to download and deploy to my own environment?  

* Once the solution has been created, downloading the associated Helm chart is nearly instantaneous. You can then deploy that Helm chart in your cloud environment of choice. 

### 4. I don’t want to deploy my solution externally, does HCL have an in-house Kubernetes hosting option? 

* HCL offers an in-house native cloud service called HCL Now. Keep your solution and Kubernetes all-in-one place – [find out more information here](https://www.hcltechsw.com/hcl-now).

### 5. Can I name my solution the same thing as a previous solution I’ve built? 

* Solution names must be unique for a single user. If you have deleted a solution, you may then name a new solution or rename an old solution with that same naming convention.

### 6. I deleted a solution but now I want it back – can I recover it somewhere? 

* Unfortunately, no. Once deleted, your solution is gone. Fortunately, SoFy’s Catalog makes recreating a deleted solution both quickly and easily.

### 7. If I’ve already clicked “Create” on my solution, can I change the selected components (add or delete more solutions)? 

* Yes! Within your Solution Details page, click the “REBUILD” button in the upper right-hand side next to the “DEPLOY” button. Here, you can either rebuild the current solution or rebuild as a new version.


### 8. Is there a limit to the number of solutions and Sandbox deployments I can create? 

* There is no limit to the number of solutions you can create, but you are limited to 2 active sandboxes at one time.

### 9. Can I use my own cloud hosting environment to deploy my SoFy Solution?  

* Yes! SoFy Helm charts are compatible with all Kubernetes environments. Whether you choose a public cloud, such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or prefer a private platform, such as Anthos GKE, SoFy Solutions are portable. 

### 10. What are SoFy Common Catalog Services? 

* Included with any built SoFy Solution are the native SoFy Common Services:
    * SoFy Access Control Service
    * Solution Console
    * Prometheus
    * Grafana
    * Anchor 
    * Ambassador
