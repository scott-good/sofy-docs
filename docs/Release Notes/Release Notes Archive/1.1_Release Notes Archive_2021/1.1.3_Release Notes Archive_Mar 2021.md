#### **What's New**
Various bug fixes and improvements include: 

* **New Catalog Design**
  * While browsing the catalog, you may notice that the previous "Products" and "Services" tabs have been removed. This singular catalog view now orders all items alphabetically by default.

    * The "Added Services" card has been renamed to "SoFy Common Services"
    * A solution description section has been added
    * Kubernetes resources and Resource utilization are combined into a single section
