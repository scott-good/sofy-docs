### Release Version: 1.0.1305

<br> 

#### **What's New**
Various bug fixes and UI improvements include:

**Product Inquiries**

On the SoFy feedback panel (question mark icon on the right upper corner), you now have the option to inquire further about specific HCL Software products. Click the 'Open Product Form' button and submit the form to receive selected product information.

**Improved Versioning Messaging**

When rebuilding a solution, we've improved our versioning messaging and verification.

**Status Pending Banner**

When you deploy a solution from SoFy, the button "View in Solution Console" allows you to open your solution even if the status is still pending. A new warning banner will appear at the top if pods and jobs are pending. Once ready, the health icons will turn green, not yellow.
