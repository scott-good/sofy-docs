#### **What's New**
Various bug fixes and improvements include:

* **Solution List Sorting**
    * On the Solutions page, clicking **Solution Name** will sort solutions alphabetically in ascending/descending order and clicking  **Updated** will sort the solution list in ascending/descending order based on when the solution was created or updated. 

* **UI Changes**
    * When you create a new solution and deploy it to the sandbox, the Solution Console will display a new Jobs card under the Kubernetes Resources section. Click on the card to view more details.
    * Within the Solution Console, the Solution Content now displays a new Associated K8s Resources section on the right side of the page. This will allow you to drill down on the usage of Kubernetes resources from the product level. To view this, click on **Solution Content** and then **General information** on your product.
