### Release Version: 1.0.1163

<br>

#### **What's New**
Various bug fixes and improvements include:

**API Directory**

* From the top header, a new page has been added, "API Directory". For the first time, you can view HCL Software's containerized APIs in one place. Clicking on an API will link you to its associated Product Details page. Check back for regular additions to this directory.

**Catalog Filters**
* A new filter option called "Asset Type" has been added to the SoFy Catalog and API Directory; this describes Products and Modules. Products are HCL's cloud native product offerings and Modules are product components or independent services which can be used as part of a larger solution.
