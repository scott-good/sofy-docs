#### **What's New**
Various bug fixes and improvements include:

**Extended Sandbox**

* Solutions can now be extended to 30 days. This extended trial experience can only be registered once per solution. To extend your sandbox, first click the deploy button. The "Extend Sandbox" option will appear momentarily on the Sandbox Panel.

**Catalog Description**

* Within Products, Modules, and Demos, our catalog also contains three variable cases. If an item is either Preview, Documentation, or Add-on, an info description icon will display in the top right corner of the product details page.

     * Preview: Preview items can be deployed in the SoFy Sandbox but are unable to be downloaded.
     * Documentation: Documentation items provide high-level overviews and describe core workflows that can be explored with the given product. To benefit from these items, add the associated product to your solution.
     * Add-on: An Add-on, like a Demo Pack, needs to be bundled with its coordinating product. Add-ons are not meant to stand-alone in a solution.
