### Release Version: 1.0.1197

#### **What's New**
Various bug fixes and improvements include:

**Introducing a New Catalog Offering ⁠— Demos**

* Our catalog offers a new category — **Demos** provide ways to explore product capabilities, with scenarios you can try out in the product itself. SoFy **Demo Packs** contain demo assets like data, configuration, and applications, that can be installed with a product to provide a richer demo experience. Note: When adding a demo pack to a solution, it will automatically add the associated product to the solution. [Read more in our Guides](https://hclsofy.com/ua/guides#catalog-overview).

**Home Page Updates**

* The [home page](http://hclsofy.com/home) has new messaging and content updates. Scroll down to see some recent feedback from active SoFy customers.

**Enhanced Support**

* In the event SoFy runs into any issue while building a solution or deploying in the SoFy Sandbox, the error message that appears now allows you to open a support ticket. The error details section can be easily copied to add into the service ticket.

**Additional Catalog Filters**

* Just below the search bar on the right hand side, there is now an easy way to filter out Products, Modules, and Demos.

**Solution Console**

* On the home page under Kubernetes Resources, a new Jobs card has been added.  This allows you to quickly view the status and logs of Jobs running as part of your solution. Note: You can view these new features of Solution Console by creating new solutions or rebuilding any existing ones.

**Custom Error Pages for your Solution**

* SoFy Solutions can create custom error pages for Ambassador using a new resource called ErrorPage. The steps to do so can be found in our new guide [here](https://hclsofy.com/ua/guides#creating-a-custom-error-page-for-your-solution).
