#### **What's New**
This update clears existing solutions. You will need to rebuild any previous solutions. Other various bug fixes and improvements include:

* **Viewing logs from previous runs of a container**
  * In the Solution Console, from the Kubernetes Resources Pods Information, we have added a link to the previous run of a container when a pod has failed and restarted. This is helpful because it allows you to view a previous pod's log information. The link is found in the Containers column, represented by a clipboard icon with a "**!**" on it.

* **Logs view on the Diagnostic Data Panel**
  * From the Logs Viewer of the Solution Console, clicking the "Download Logs" dropdown will open the Diagnostic Data panel. If you choose "Download Opened Logs", they will automatically be selected in the panel. The Advanced view allows you to select any other logs of your choosing.

* **Release Notes**
  * You may have noticed that our Release Notes have moved. You can find them in the following: In the footer, top-right corner of the Guides page, and within the announcement tab when there is a new update.
